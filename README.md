Scenarios -
a. Its the day of the Kaluza annual conference being held at the Southbank
Centre in London but you're at the office in 69 Notting Hill Gate in London.
Plan the quickest journey between the two (ie the journey with the shortest
travel time between the two)

b. You're at the office in 69 Notting Hill Gate London but need to get to the
Bristol office that is around the corner from Bristol Temple Meads train
station. Plan your journey from the london office to the train station in
bristol

c. Our Belfast based Lead qa is traveling to london for a day of meetings.
He's arriving into Luton Airport next wednesday for meetings and needs to
arrive at the office by 8.50am. Plan a journey with the latest time he can
leave luton airport to arrive at the office by 8.50am

Assumptions:
● The test preparation & execution should be on the API level
● Write in typescript (preferable) or javascript
● Use Cucumber
● Code to be shared via github and your repo should include everything needed to
execute the tests.
● Demonstrate the test execution (an automation report will suffice - you can commit it in your git repo)
